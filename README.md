MSU - Homework 04: Code Quiz

## Overview

For this project I created a coding assessment. It is a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions that stores the highscores. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
